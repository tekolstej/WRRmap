# WRRmap
Map of sampling sites in the Wind River Range (WRR) of Wyoming. Regions are categorized spatially and sample sites are informed by historical dust deposition patterns. Historical deposition patterns (Dahms, 1993; Brahney et al., 2013) show a gradient of dust contributions from the neighboring Green River Basin (GRB) to WRR mountain catenas with the Southwestern portion recieving greater dust than the northern portion of the range.
